# PayzDesk — Progress Summary

**Last updated:** 2026-05-27 (Phase 2 ✅ COMPLETE)
**Stack:** Next.js 16 · TypeScript · Tailwind v4 · App Router

---

## Project Goal

Build **PayzDesk** — a complete web-based payment agent management platform — by converting the SuperPayz Android app into a mobile-first web app.

### What we are building

A feature-complete web replica of the SuperPayz Android APK, rebranded as PayzDesk, with:

- Our own independent codebase (Next.js + TypeScript)
- Our own backend (Next.js API routes)
- Our own database (MongoDB Atlas)
- Dark theme design system (deep navy + gold accent + green CTAs)
- Mobile-first UI with hamburger drawer nav (no bottom tabs)

### What we are changing from the reference app

| Item            | SuperPayz (reference)      | PayzDesk                               |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Name & branding | SuperPayz                  | PayzDesk ("Payz" white + "Desk" gold)  |
| Platform        | Android APK only           | Mobile-first web (any browser)         |
| Auth            | Phone + device SIM         | Phone + SMS OTP (no device dependency) |
| App Lock        | Device PIN / Face ID       | Session inactivity timeout             |
| Native share    | Android share sheet        | Web Share API + copy to clipboard      |
| Color theme     | Dark navy, amber/gold CTAs | Dark navy, gold accent, green CTAs     |
| Some taglines   | Original SuperPayz copy    | Rewritten for PayzDesk brand voice     |
| Referral prefix | SPZ…                       | PDK…                                   |

### What stays exactly the same

- All features and flows (deposits, withdrawals, UTR, banks, commissions, referral, live pool, reports, settings)
- Navigation structure (side drawer with exact same item order)
- Screen layouts and information hierarchy (matching screenshots)
- Filter bar pattern (status dropdown + search + CLEAR + DATE)
- Card/badge/button visual language

### Settings & Profile ✅
